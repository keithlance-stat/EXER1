			<h2>Favorite Com Sci Subject: CMSC 22</h2>
			<p>I really enjoyed all my com sci classes but my favorite was CMSC 22. The way the class was taught in a very systematic manner and the requirements were very reasonable. I really enjoyed the lab exam where we created a system for an amusement park. The professors were also very patient in answering our questions. Unfortunately, the class was cut short because of the pandemic.</p>

			<h2>Favorite GE Subject: STS 1</h2>
			<p>At first, I wasn't planning to take the course in my first year but because it was the only GE class available at the time. The topics in the class are very ineteresting tackling science and society and how it affects each other. The activities were also unique and interactive that made learning more enjoyable. Our professor was also very nice, humorous and very considerate.

			<h2>Favorite Programming Language: Python</h2>
			<p>Python was the first programming language I learned. It was very easy to learn and it is user-friendly. I really had fun using it in our laboratory and creating my project. All the other programming languages that I learned, I base it on python so I could understand the programming language better. </p>
